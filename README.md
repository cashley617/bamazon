# Meet BAmazon. 

BAmazon is the Amazon-alternative. It keep an inventory of current products, and compares that to customer requests. 

If BAmazon can fill your order, you'll be given a total price and message of congratulations. If your request returns an insufficient quantity, BAmazon will send its deepest regret. 

I am the sole contributor to this project.
